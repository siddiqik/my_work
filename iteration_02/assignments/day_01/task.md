# Day 1 Lab Task: Initial Partner Work

## Objectives
By the end of today, each pair should:
- Find your partner and agree on roles.
- Push your **initial data structure ideas** so each partner has at least one commit.
- Complete a **merged Pull Request** before class ends.

---

## Tasks for Today

1. **Partner Up**
   - Decide on roles: e.g., one works on `Restaurant` class, the other on `MenuItem` class or menu logic.
   - Discuss initial approach and design for your classes and JSON structure.

2. **Push Initial Data Structures**
   - Each partner adds initial Python files or placeholders for classes.
   - Commit your files so both partners have visible contributions.

3. **Collaborate**
   - Open a Pull Request for your initial work.
   - Review your partner’s code and approve the PR.

4. **Merge**
   - Ensure at least one Pull Request is **merged into `main`** by the end of class.
   - Confirm that both partners’ commits are visible in GitHub history.

## Deliverables for Today
- Repo with initial Python files for classes.
- Evidence of **collaboration** (commits from both partners).
- PR opened, reviewed, and merged.
- A shared starting point for your project to continue in upcoming classes.

---

## Notes
- Today’s focus is **setup and collaboration**, not full feature implementation.
- Keep commits small and descriptive.
- Use the separate Git/GitHub document for any command reference.
