Week 01 Lab : Standard Level
Due Date: Sunday 9/7 @ midnight

    Objective: Utilize basic python data types, loops, conditionals, and user data in small program according
               to a set of criteria below.

    - Create a program that asks the user for their...
        - name
        - age
        - if they are multilingual

    - Program should accomplish the set of criteria listed below
        1. Print a statement that greets the user by name and welcomes them to the program
        2. User data is stored inside of a dictionary
        3. If the user is under 13 state that the user cannot sit in the passenger seat of a car
            - if the user is under 18 then state that the user cannot vote
            - If the user is under 25 state that the user cannot rent a car
            - If the user is over 35 state that they are getting old...
        4. If the user is multilingual, ask the user how many languages they speak.
            - Use a loop to ask the user for each of the 'n' language that they speak and each language entered.
            - If the user is not multilingual, ask the user to enter a language that they wish to learn. Print this back to user.
        5. Ask if another user would like to enter their information as well. All dictionaries with user data should be appended
           to a list with info of all users. Only end program when user specifies that they are done.
        5. Program is considered complete if...
            - Program prints greeting with user name
            - Program prints out all statements appropriate for user age
            - Program prints languages spoken or language user wishes to learn for user
            - Program prints list of all user dictionaries when done
        

            

Week 01 Lab : Advanced Level
Due Date: Sunday 9/7 @ midnight

    Objective: Build an interactive program that practices input/output, conditionals, data structures, and introduces a new
               tool/library (GUI or formatted output). The program should take user information and present it in a polished, 
               engaging way.

    Requirements: GUI or Rich Input/Output. A simple GUI toolkit (tkinter/turtle, or PyQt if you already know tkinter). Or a terminal UI
               library (rich or textual) for nicely formatted text. Collect the same base data as the beginner assignment.

               
    - Create a program that asks the user for their...

        - Name
        - Age
        - Multilingual status

    - Program should accomplish the set of criteria listed below

        1. For age rules, instead of just printing messages, display a progression of privileges (driving, voting, renting a car, etc.)
          in a formatted way (e.g., a list, progress bar, or GUI checkboxes).
        2. Language handling. If multilingual, ask for all the languages. Store them in a data structure and display them nicely (for example, in a
            sorted list, or with flags/emojis if using rich).
        3. If not multilingual, ask for a desired language and display a “learning plan” (could just be a fun random tip or suggested practice hours generated in code).

    - Bonus Challenges (optional but encouraged):
        1. Write user data to a JSON file so that the program “remembers” users between runs.
        2. Translate a greeting into one of the listed languages using a library like googletrans.
        3. Use datetime to estimate what year the user can vote, rent a car, or retire.
