# Instructions for students:
# 1. Create a NEW folder for your Shape Toolkit project.
# 2. Inside that folder, create three files:
#      - shapes.py
#          * Define at least three classes: Rectangle, Circle, Triangle
#          * Each class should have attributes, area() method, and describe() method
#      - utils.py
#          * Create helper functions, e.g., convert cm^2 to m^2
#          * Compare areas of two shapes
#      - main_lab.py
#          * Import classes from shapes.py
#          * Import helper functions from utils.py
#          * Allow user to create shapes (input dimensions)
#          * Print area and descriptions
# 3. Make sure every function and class has proper docstrings
# 4. Run main_lab.py to see interactive results
# 5. Optional Bonus:
#      - Add a welcome function in main_lab.py (no return value) that explains available shapes
#      - Allow user to choose which shapes to create dynamically

# Deliverable:
#   - One organized folder
#   - Three files (shapes.py, utils.py, main_lab.py)
#   - Proper use of functions with and without return values
#   - Proper use of classes and docstrings
#   - Modular, readable, and organized code
